## Introduction

The following presentation is a guide for using my shiny application. 

The purpose of this application is to predict the **gas mileage** of cars in the mtcars dataset **on the basis of engine displacement**. 

## Instructions

1. Initiate the shiny application
2. Choose the value for engine displacement (0-500)
3. Check/Uncheck the boxes for the model you would like to use
4. View the plot and underlying text to find the estimated gas mileage

## Summary of Dataset (mtcars)

```{r cars, echo = TRUE}
summary(mtcars)
```
